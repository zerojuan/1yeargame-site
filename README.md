1 Year Game Challenge
=====================

is a 1 year game making challenge focused on polish and the last 10%.

You have one year to finish a game worthy of peopleâ€™s hard earned cash and adulation.

#What? Why?!

Game Jams are cool and all, but there's an awfully huge difference between that game you made in 48 hours and the games people want to spend money on.

#How?

You, developer person/team, submit a prototype to us.

On the June IGDA Meetup, you declare to the general public that by next year, June 2013, you have the best game that you can make ever.
                
We, the IGDA-Manila people, will use all our powers to make sure you don't flake out/get depressed/pursue other dreams.

#Mechanics                

1. Every month, developers are required to submit a build. A build presentation during the monthly meetup is encouraged but not required.

2. People vote for their favorite build on this site.

3. By the end of the challenge, the game with the highest average monthly vote is the winner.

#Restrictions

1. Entries should be at the prototype stage.

2. Teams can change members, but keep at least one original team member throughout the year.

3. Teams can "pivot". But no complete rewrites.

4. The developers retain their IP rights. But we reserve the right to promote your game in any IGDA related event.

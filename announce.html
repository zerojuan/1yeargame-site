                    and the last 10%.</p>

                <p>Game Jams are cool and all, but there's an awfully huge difference between that game you made in 48 hours and the games people want to spend money on.</p>                
                <p><a name="how"><h2>How?</h2></a></p>
                <p>You, developer person/team, submit a prototype to us.</p>
                <p>On the June IGDA Meetup, you declare to the general public that by next year, June 2013, you have the best game that you can make ever.</p>
                <p>We, the IGDA-Manila people, will use all our powers to make sure you don't flake out/get depressed/pursue other dreams.</p>

                        <li>By the end of the challenge, the game with the highest average monthly vote is the winner.</li>
